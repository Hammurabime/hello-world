On My Path to Pencilopia
My name is Zakari Hasmiu. I work at konga.com.
   I was first introduced to programming through BASIC. Then PASCAL (I remember solving Matrix Algebra with 30 lines code)I want to learn how to build functional apps that are lean because, fast internet connection is not reliable were I come from.
I'm excited about Github.Comming from codecademy,I hope this will give what I really need.
